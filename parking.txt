From an enforcement perspective, I would think that the active sensor data 
would hold the most promise in conjunction with usage data (which is
unfortunately missing). If we were to pinpoint the most used meters, we could
outfit them with license plate readers similar to those on the Golden Gate toll
bridge so as to automate payment and reduce delinquency. That said, that might
not be cost effective, but I think it would at least be prudent to upgrade as
many meters to smart meters as possible because in my experience, more people
carry around credit/debit cards than they do coins, and it would make both
payment and collection easier. Granted, this is coming from someone with
minimal business experience, but those would be my intuitive first guesses.
